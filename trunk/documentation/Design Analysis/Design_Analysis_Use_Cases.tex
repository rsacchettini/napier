\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Objectives}
The Napier Estate Agency is a ?rm which deals in the selling of property within the UK. At the moment all sales are made either in person at the branch, or by telephone. The ?rm has both buyers and sellers. Sellers list their properties with the agency who then advertise them on the front window of the branch. Buyers can then see these properties and enter the branch to ?nd out more information or arrange to view the property.
The client feels that by advertising the properties only on the window of the branch, they are limiting the number of buyers attracted. They wish to reach out to more potential buyers, and make ?nding out information and arranging visits to properties easier for them. The client also wishes to allow sellers to list properties themselves. The group has decided that in order to achieve these goals an online estate agency site should be created.
The website needs to have several functions. It must allow anyone who wants to buy or sell a property to register on the website and get an account.
With this account, the user will be able to add properties, browse and search all the properties ordered, ?nd out more detailed information about each property, and arrange visits to properties.
The system will also be used by employees of the estate agency. It must allow the estate agents to view all the properties. They will be able to verify properties added by users before they go online, they will then be able to edit and remove a property at any time. The estate agent should be able to see a list of potential buyers for each property and have some method to contact each one.
The website must be consistent throughout each page. As the majority of people using the site are likely to not be technical people the site has to be easy to navigate and intuitive. It is important that searching the properties is easy to do and e?ective.
The website will be created using groovy java. This is a relatively new programming language based on java. Its syntax is similar to that of java, but simpler. There are far fewer rules which will make coding the site relatively easy.
