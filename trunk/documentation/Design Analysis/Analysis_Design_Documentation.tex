\section{Introduction}
This class diagram highlights the classes discovered during the analysis,
and some additional classes discovered during the design of our application.
You will notice that there are no methods in our classes related to the reading, the creation, the deletion nor the updating.
There are no such methods because we assume that these features are handled from the roots by the Grails Framework.
