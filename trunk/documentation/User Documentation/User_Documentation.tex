\section{Introduction and Overview}
\subsection{Introduction}
This material is provided to explain to an end user what the main features of the application are and how to use them, step by step.
An end user could be a seller, a buyer, or an estate agent.

\paragraph{}
The Napier Estate Agency Application is a Groovy/Grails website, we are not going to explain how to set-up the website,
we assume that this is not an end user task and that it will be handled by the IT department of your company.

\subsection{Main features}
The main feature of this application is the management of a property (registering a new property with its details, pictures, characteristics, and being able to edit it).
Because this is an important feature and will be one of the most commonly used, we are going to explain it fully in this document.

Now you can click on "New property" on the top action bar.
